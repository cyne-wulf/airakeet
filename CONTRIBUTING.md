# Contributing to the Airakeet landing site

1. Fork this repository or create a feature branch on your clone.
2. Keep assets lightweight (static HTML/CSS/JS) to avoid adding a build pipeline.
3. Use descriptive commit messages and include screenshots/GIFs in PR descriptions for visual tweaks.
4. Verify the site locally by opening the HTML file(s) in a browser before submitting a pull request.
5. Target the `main` branch; GitHub Pages deploys directly from it.
