# Airakeet Landing Site

This repository hosts the static marketing site for Airakeet, the proprietary, local-first dictation engine designed for 8GB Apple Silicon machines.

## Structure
- `index.html` – main landing page with product overview.
- `purchase.html` – early-access purchase instructions and contact form.
- `showcase.html` – placeholder for upcoming workflow gallery.
- `styles.css` / `script.js` – shared styling and interactivity.
- `Final-icon.png`, `share-card.png` – iconography and Open Graph assets.

## Development
No build tooling is required. Update the HTML/CSS/JS files directly and open a pull request. Changes deploy to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

## Deployment
1. Commit updates to `main` (or merge via PR).
2. GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → `main`/`root`) serves the site at https://cyne-wulf.github.io/airakeet/.
